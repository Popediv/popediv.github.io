I'm sorry you have to go through that stress before you'd decrypt this message.

I‚Äôve been meaning to reach out, and today feels like the right moment. First, I want to say I‚Äôm
truly sorry for not being there on your convocation day. I know how much that day meant to you,
and I regret not showing up for you or even sending a message. You deserve so much better. I
hope you can forgive me and know that I‚Äôm willing to be present in the days ahead‚Äîthrough
your highs and lows, your hills and plateaus.

These past weeks, I‚Äôve had a lot to think about. When I asked you about us, your response,
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how it goes,‚Äù has stayed with me. I‚Äôve held onto it with hope because the truth is, my
feelings for you have only grown stronger.

You‚Äôre an incredible woman‚Äîkind, intelligent, and so full of grace. Being around you makes
everything brighter. I want to be that person you can rely on, the one who makes you smile, and
the one who stands by you, no matter what.

I know opening your heart isn‚Äôt something you take lightly, and I respect that. But I want you to
know that I‚Äôm here‚Äîready to love you, care for you, and give you my all. I don‚Äôt want to rush
you or push too hard; I just want you to feel safe enough to let me in when you‚Äôre ready.

By the grace of this festive season, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year. I hope it‚Äôs filled with happiness, warmth, and the love you deserve. I hope we can explore
this year together in love.
I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è

I will be expecting a response soon.

With all my heart,
Divine.`;
