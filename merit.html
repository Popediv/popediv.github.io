I'm sorry you have to go through that stress before you'd decrypt this message.

I’ve been meaning to reach out, and today feels like the right moment. First, I want to say I’m
truly sorry for not being there on your convocation day. I know how much that day meant to you,
and I regret not showing up for you or even sending a message. You deserve so much better. I
hope you can forgive me and know that I’m willing to be present in the days ahead—through
your highs and lows, your hills and plateaus.

These past weeks, I’ve had a lot to think about. When I asked you about us, your response,
“Let’s see how it goes,” has stayed with me. I’ve held onto it with hope because the truth is, my
feelings for you have only grown stronger.

You’re an incredible woman—kind, intelligent, and so full of grace. Being around you makes
everything brighter. I want to be that person you can rely on, the one who makes you smile, and
the one who stands by you, no matter what.

I know opening your heart isn’t something you take lightly, and I respect that. But I want you to
know that I’m here—ready to love you, care for you, and give you my all. I don’t want to rush
you or push too hard; I just want you to feel safe enough to let me in when you’re ready.

As we step into this new year, I want to pause and wish you everything beautiful that life and 
God can offer. I hope this year fills your heart with endless joy, surrounds you with love, and
brings every dream you hold dear to life. You deserve nothing less.

I’ve been thinking a lot about how much you mean to me. With every day that passes, my love for
you grows deeper and stronger. You’ve become such a light in my life, and I can’t help but feel
so grateful for the blessing of having you close. You bring a brightness to my world that words 
can hardly capture, and I pray this year lights up your life in the same way you’ve brightened mine.

As we walk into this new chapter, my greatest prayer is to journey through it with Jesus at the
center and you by my side. With faith as our anchor, I believe we can build something beautiful, 
something strong and eternal. I want to cherish every moment with you, to share in your joys and 
your struggles, and to grow together in love and purpose.

Merit, I love you with everything in me. Thank you for being you—for your kindness, your strength,
and the way you inspire me to be the best version of myself. I am ready to stand by you, to care 
for you, and to love you more deeply with each passing day.

Here’s to a year of love, faith, and endless possibilities. Let’s make this journey one to 
remember—together, hand in hand, with hope in our hearts.

I love you ❤️

With all my heart,
Divine.`;
